# ThoughtSo
ThoughtSo is a cross-platform [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) & [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/) To Do List application. It is largely inspired by (but not a direct copy of) the tutorial by [the YouTube channel "Made With Matt"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kL6nhutjQ8) and made mainly with JavaScript.

## Description
This application functions like any other To Do List.

## Step-by-step guide - *"How do I actually use this site?"*

First, download the files to your own computer, and then navigate to the project via your preferred CLI (e.g.; `PS C:\Users\yourusernamehere> cd C:\Users\yourusernamehere\OneDrive\Files\GitHub\ThoughtSo\expoToDo`). Then type in the command `code .` to have the code open in Visual Studio Code, if that's the IDE you prefer to use and for troubleshooting `npm react-native doctor` works well.

Once you've navigated to the directory of the project you're trying to run (`cd`[insert file path here]), you can run metro (`npm start`/`npx expo start`) and android/iOS (`npm run android`/`npx react-native run android`) (on two separate Command Prompt tabs), connecting your project to an emulator from Android Studio.
